# Headphones

## Must be headphones, not earphones

I simply don't have the ear to keep earphones from falling. I've tested many devices, some even with wings, and I've yet to find ones that I like. So, for the time being, I'm sticking to headphones.

## Must be Bluetooth-enabled

But must also provide cable in case battery dies

## Quality isn't a priority, but can't sound too cheap

Considering I'm looking for a setup specifically for podcast listening, sound quality isn't that much of priority.Â 

1. Noise cancelling is nice to have, but not a priority
1. Must be able to operate with one hand  
From quickly putting one headphone to the side, to being able to put on the headset with one hand

## Must support A2DP. Bonus for Next/Previous buttons

I originally thought that a podcast device with dedicated hardware buttons would eliminate the need for a headphone to have them. But boy was I wrong. After using a device with A2DP issues, I now consider this a must.
