# Portable Device

## Rules

### Must be running Android (preferably) or iOS

After trying out a few portable music players, I realized that the best solution to having all the features you need is by using a popular mobile OS with an app store. That way you are not restricted to the features of the device.

Of course, that comes at a cost. A lot of the benefits I mentioned in my intro have to do with dedicated devices. However, at least for now, there isn't any dedicated podcast player out there. There are music players, but as mentioned earlier, those don't cut it. So until such a device exists, the next best option is an Android or iOS device. Even compared to the very very expensive Android music players out there.

But it's not all bad. One way to get closer to a dedicated podcast player is by enabling Kiosk mode. This essentially locks an app in full screen and prevents accidentally switching away from it. Android calls this feature Pinned Apps while iOS Guided Access. 

Android has a slight advantage though. While both lock the app in full screen, when you wake up the device from sleep (which in iOS is an extra step every time to enable it), on Android there is no lock screen. Instead, the app is still locked in full screen. On iOS, you need to dismiss the lock screen before you get to the full screen app.

For this reason, I prefer Android devices over iOS. 

### Must support Bluetooth and have 3.5mm audio jack

I've been using Bluetooth headsets since at least 2011, and I ain't gonna stop now. However, since I listen to podcasts many hours, I occasionally need to use a cable until I get a chance to charge the headset. Not listening is not an option.
Huge plus for extra hardware buttons (Play/Pause, Next/Previous, etc)

Having a dedicated device usually means having dedicated hardware buttons. Anything that reduces the amount of time I have to use the touch screen is a plus.

### Must have a screen no more than 4" in size

I already carry around a 6'' Samsung Galaxy Note 8, I'm not looking to have two of them. And I prefer a device with a touch screen over a two-row LCD screen. Unless the device has dedicated hardware buttons.
Must support Wifi

While I don't care for mobile data support since I'm always somewhere with Wifi access, I do care to avoid having to download and transfer files manually every time to my device. I tried it. No thank you.
