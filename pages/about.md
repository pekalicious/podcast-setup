# The Quest for the Best Distraction-Free Portable Podcast Experience

This is my journey into finding the perfect setup for listening to podcasts on the go. This has been ongoing for almost two years now, testing and using many different product combinations to find that one perfect solution that fits all my needs.

And I'm still searching…

## But why?
I am a big proponent of dedicated devices. Sure, I will use my phone to snap a quick photo, but I also have a DSLR for my "serious" photography. Sure, I do some light reading on my phone, but I also own (and love) a Kindle Oasis 2… and 1… and Paperwhite… and Keyboard… OK, I may have a problem there. And sure, I may be able to play games on my phone, but I prefer doing so on my very beefy desktop rig (PCMR FTW).

I don't think it's controversial to say that dedicated devices are better at what they are built for compared to general devices. And before you say "phone cameras produce indistinguishable quality in photos" we are not just talking about quality. A DSLR has a whole industry of dedicated peripherals that phones simply do not have except for the very niche models that will become obsolete in 2 years (or less). From standard hot shoe flashes, to standard (per brand) lenses, to standard tranceivers, stands, and a whole slew of other specific gear. Any attempt to create equivalent gear for phones is simply a very niche market by definition: people buy DSLRs because they want to take photos, the same cannot be said about phones. People buy phones for a myriad of reasons, some of which *might* be for photos. If you are a photo gear manufacturer, which audience are you more likely to target and support long-term?

And then of course we cannot omit another great advantage of dedicated devices: generally speaking, they have great battery life. Sometimes 100 times that of your phone. Kindle and DSLRs both have this. Their hardware is designed to do one specific thing and do it well.
In addition to that, I've been trying to reduce my screen time and, more importantly, any distractions from my phone. I've disabled 99% of all app notifications. Pretty much only instant messaging apps will nudge me. But those notifications are still annoying when you are trying to concentrate on listening to a story-driven podcast. Almost by definition, dedicated devices are distraction-free. A Kindle will not pop a single notification even if you are reading for 8 hours straight. Same with DSLRs.

And so, with all this in mind, I decided I want a dedicated podcast listening device. And because it turned out to be (and still is) quite an enormous undertaking considering the simplicity of my requirements, I decided to document my adventures in the hopes that either I will help somebody out there looking for the same, or somebody can help me finally find the best solution out there, if it even exists.

## The Process
It is important to right down what exactly I consider a great podcast device. Even though it's niche, it might still differ from somebody else's opinion on what a great podcast device experience is. So before we move on to the reviews, let me explain what I am looking for from a setup.

### Requirements
Your first thought might be "oh, you mean a simple mp3 player", but you'd be wrong. See, there's a reason why I say "podcast device" specifically and not "music device" generally. Interestingly, there are some features required in podcast (and audio book) listening that 99% of simple mp3 players do not have: continuing from where you left off when powering on your device. So that pretty much immediately knocks out all cheap mp3 players out there.

Interestingly, that also knocks out the more expensive and dedicated devices like the Conwo Platue. Even though some of them run Android, they restrict what apps you can install on them even if via side-loading.

And since we are on the subject of software, let use begin our requirements regarding software
### Final thoughts on requirements
While most requirements are built based on bad experiences I've had in the past with devices I tested, they constantly change depending on newly discovered features.

For example, right now I prefer devices with Android or iOS, but if I find a portable device that has Spotify (something that's been trending lately) and that setup is better than an Android with my preferred podcast app, the requirements will change, and so will the scoring to reflect the updated information. 

This is a consequence of not having a perfect setup. You constantly search for one and continuously discover things you like that you otherwise wouldn't even think about.

The purpose of this journey is to delete this entire document and write a new one titled "The Perfect Distraction-Free Podcast Experience".

Until then, this website will only grow.

## How I test and score
Unless otherwise specified, I test most devices for at least a month. I listen to podcasts for at least 3 hours a day average.

Scores are strictly in relation to the purpose of using them for a podcast setup and not of the device as a whole.
