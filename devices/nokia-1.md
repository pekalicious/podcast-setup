1/5 overall score
Price: $60 new from Amazon (when ordered on Jul 2019)

This was the quickest NOPE out of all the devices I tried.

OK, granted, this device is stupid cheap. At only $60 new, you have a full blown Android 7 Go device. Small, very light, and good build quality (albeit a little "plasticky").

But the hardware is so limiting that simply waking up the device to play a particular podcast took 10-20 seconds each time. I'm still keeping this device for an emergency backup phone though.
