# The Quest for the Best Distraction-Free Portable Podcast Experience

This is my journey into finding the perfect setup for listening to podcasts on the go. This has been ongoing for almost two years now, testing and using many different product combinations to find that one perfect solution that fits all my needs.

And I'm still searching…

## But why?
I am a big proponent of dedicated devices. Sure, I will use my phone to snap a quick photo, but I also have a DSLR for my "serious" photography. Sure, I do some light reading on my phone, but I also own (and love) a Kindle Oasis 2… and 1… and Paperwhite… and Keyboard… OK, I may have a problem there. And sure, I may be able to play games on my phone, but I prefer doing so on my very beefy desktop rig (PCMR FTW).

I don't think it's controversial to say that dedicated devices are better at what they are built for compared to general devices. And before you say "phone cameras produce indistinguishable quality in photos" we are not just talking about quality. A DSLR has a whole industry of dedicated peripherals that phones simply do not have except for the very niche models that will become obsolete in 2 years (or less). From standard hot shoe flashes, to standard (per brand) lenses, to standard tranceivers, stands, and a whole slew of other specific gear. Any attempt to create equivalent gear for phones is simply a very niche market by definition: people buy DSLRs because they want to take photos, the same cannot be said about phones. People buy phones for a myriad of reasons, some of which *might* be for photos. If you are a photo gear manufacturer, which audience are you more likely to target and support long-term?

And then of course we cannot omit another great advantage of dedicated devices: generally speaking, they have great battery life. Sometimes 100 times that of your phone. Kindle and DSLRs both have this. Their hardware is designed to do one specific thing and do it well.
In addition to that, I've been trying to reduce my screen time and, more importantly, any distractions from my phone. I've disabled 99% of all app notifications. Pretty much only instant messaging apps will nudge me. But those notifications are still annoying when you are trying to concentrate on listening to a story-driven podcast. Almost by definition, dedicated devices are distraction-free. A Kindle will not pop a single notification even if you are reading for 8 hours straight. Same with DSLRs.

And so, with all this in mind, I decided I want a dedicated podcast listening device. And because it turned out to be (and still is) quite an enormous undertaking considering the simplicity of my requirements, I decided to document my adventures in the hopes that either I will help somebody out there looking for the same, or somebody can help me finally find the best solution out there, if it even exists.
