2/5 overall score
Price: $69.99 renewed on Amazon (when ordered on Jul 2019)

This was the device that made me realize I prefer small screens.

On the surface, this looks like the perfect fit. An Android 7 device (not a phone), with plenty of storage, Bluetooth and 3.5mm jack, awesome dock charger, large screen and very light. And as a generic Android device, it's amazing. I still have it next to my monitor for various use cases. I still don't know why this isn't more popular, or why other manufacturers don't produce similar devices. I have 2! I accidentally ordered the 8GB which doesn't have enough storage for more than a single app, so I ordered the 16GB and kept them both.

But as a podcast player, there's one unfortunate design flaw, and it has to do with the amazing dock charger: it's designed for it. 

This device's original purpose is to be used as a cool Android remote for Vizio products. Hence the dock charger: most of the time it's expected to stay there and occasionally be picked up to change the channel. So the power button is designed to be pressed easily. But this doesn't work well in a pocket. I would constantly be pressing it accidentally and it would change the episode I was listening to all the time. Plus, the size turned out to be bigger than I preferred for a podcast player.
