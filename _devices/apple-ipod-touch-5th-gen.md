I realized I need iOS 11 only after receiving this.

OK, this was my mistake. I didn't realize that Pocket Casts supports iOS 11 and above and that the 5th generation only goes up to iOS 9. I'm replacing it with iPod 6th Generation.

As a device, it's WAY smaller and lighter than I anticipated. That's both good and bad. It's too small for comfort, but it's as if it doesn't exist in your pocket.
