This was the closest device to perfection, but alas, there's one small issue that is enough to switch to another device.

First, the good parts. It's a 4'' Android 7 device that upgrades to 8. It's very cheap for its hardware. It has finger print reader in a very convenient location (right side of the device) and comes in a lot of fun colors (I bought the Mist blue).

It's not particularly thin or light, especially compared to an iPod. But it holds well in the hand (as opposed to an iPod) and the buttons are all in the right places. Its battery life is not bad, coming up at 3 full days with heavy listening.

But, unfortunately, this particular model has a well known issue that I discovered I can't live without: A2DP. Standing for Advanced Audio Distribution Profile, this protocol is what allows headphones to have media buttons that can Play/Pause wirelessly. The Sony Xperia X Compact unfortunately will stop receiving such signals after about 30 minutes of powering on. And the only known way to fix it is by rebooting. Which means you either have to reboot your device every hour, or you have to pull out the phone, wake it up, and press pause. That's a no to both for me.
Another peculiarity with this device is that it will occasionally, at random moments, lower the volume severely and display the "Listening to sounds above the current volume level may permantently damage your hearing" message. I haven't yet figured out what triggers this, but it will happen a few times a week.
