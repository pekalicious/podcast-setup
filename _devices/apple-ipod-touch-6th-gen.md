So far so good

Compared to the 5th generation, this is definitely heavier and feels better in the hands. But it still has the, very slippery, metal back.

The Guided Access on iOS doesn't work as good as Pinned Apps on Android. Sometimes you unlock the screen to find the app waiting for you, sometimes it'll take a few seconds for the lock screen to automatically go away, and sometimes the lock screen never goes away. Also, annoyingly, iOS keeps reminding you that Guided Access is enabled every time you unlock and hides the top part of the screen.
