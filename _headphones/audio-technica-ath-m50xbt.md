2/5 overall score

This was probably the biggest disappointment so far. From the poor clamping to the horrific button design, I stopped using these headphones after about 3 weeks. 

I really tried to make them work, but it was extremely frustrating. They are big, and while not too heavy, they don't clamp well, so I will frequently have to catch them mid-air when ducking. Another problem with the fit is that I could not put them on with one hand. Because of their folding design, they will flip the other way around making it impossible to put them on. 

And then there's the buttons. Oh god, those buttons! There's no way you could put the device in pairing mode without getting a cramp. Their placement is awkward, the button combination is absurd, the buttons are very mushy, and the amount of pressure AND seconds you need to hold is downright criminal. Simply put, it's easier to pull out its cable and temporarily connect a device than trying to pair it.
Speaking of the button design, they are so close together and the three little dotted bumps on the Play/Pause is not easily distinguished by feel, so even the simple act of Play/Pausing is frustrating.

The one good thing I can say about them is the sound quality. It's Audio Technica after all. The wired M50x was my introduction to better sounding headphones than what I was used back then, almost 10 years ago. But those were not Bluetooth-enabled. Little did I know that adding this feature would 180 my opinion of these.
