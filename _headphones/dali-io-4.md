Kinda of a scary start...

I was really looking forward to getting these headphones. I saw them on their website and was waiting for the day they would be available on amazon. As soon as they were, I ordered one.

I turned the device on, heard the prompt that it's in BT pairing mode, proceeded to connect it to my iPoad, connected pretty quickly aaaaaaaand... nothing. No sound, nothing. It was clearly connected. All lights on the headphones looked correct, iPod said it was connected, and the podcast player was playing the episode. But nothing was coming out of the heaphones.

I disconnected the iPod, but the lights on the headphones where all on as if still connected. I turned the switch to the off position and... nothing, the device lights were still showing that it was on and connected. Hold the switch for a few seconds, turned it on or off, connected with audio jack, connected it to change... Nothing I tried would make the device actually shut off. The lights were on as if this thing is still connected. I finally had to take a paper clip and stick it to the hard reset hole. 

Needless to say, this was not a good start at all.
