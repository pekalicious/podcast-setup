Overall I like the design and aesthetics of these headphones more than the functionality. 

Originally I felt that the grip was tight enough to hold them in place, but over time I realized that's not the case. And this turned out to be the biggest reason why I switched off. Even though there are many more issues, I was willing to put up with those if the grip didn't make me feel that I am restricting my head movement just to wear them.

The other issues are noticeable from the moment you put them on. First, when you power up the headphones, you get a nice audio cue that it's on. But you don't get an audio cue when a device is connected. As a consequence, you either have to wait a few seconds (at random) and then press play, or be fine with the first few seconds not being played on your headphone.

Then there's the dedicated Noise Cancelling toggle button. While I appreciate the idea of quickly switching to different modes, the button is so sensitive and extrudes so much, that you can accidentally trigger a mode switch just by accidentally bumping the headphones to your shoulder. In fact, you can also switch modes by accident when trying to power on or off the device. 

Speaking of Noise Cancelling, there is an extremely noticeable and very annoying popping sound whenever the NC is turned on or off, and this wouldn't be an issue if that happened when you turned the headphones on or off. Unfortunately, it happens when there are a few seconds of silence. So if you pause the audio for whatever reason, a popping sound will go off after a few seconds every single time.

And finally this set has a proximity sensor as one of its selling points. In *theory* it's used to sense when you take off the headphones and it will then automatically stop whatever is playing, and resume when it senses you put them back. And when it works, it's amazing. Unfortunately, as many have mentioned it online, this feature does not work. Instead, it will very frequently and randomly send an A2DP pause signal while you are wearing them. And forget about using this feature on a desktop computer. It will constantly pause a YouTube video.

As I said at the beginning, all these issues are annoying, but one feature that almost makes up for them is the dedicated toggle button. Yes, that same button that can accidentally be switched. The thing is, it's also very useful that you can switch it so easily. I've never had a way to pause my audio so fast, literally by a flick of your finger. It's the only feature I wish other headphones had instead of buttons.

Likes

- Proximity sensor not working
- Annoying poping sounds (when playing/pausing, turning on/off, and sometime randomly when there's no sound)
- They hurt when wearing for many hours
- Easily fall off
- No audio queue when device is connected
