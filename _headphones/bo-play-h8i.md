So far… OK.

At first glance, I thought this device would easily slip off. Even though I've used on ear headphones before (my beloved SOL REPUBLIC Tracks), I still wasn't confident these would hold up. But, to my surprise, they are very steady. Even shaking my head doesn't move them much.

But there are minor annoyances noticeable from the moment you put them on. First, when you power up the headphones, you get a nice audio cue that it's on. But you don't get an audio cue when a device is connected. As a consequence, you either have to wait a few seconds (at random) and then press play, or be fine with the first few seconds not being played on your headphone.

Then there's the dedicated Noise Cancelling toggle button. While I appreciate the idea of quickly switching to different modes, the button is so sensitive and extrudes so much, that you can accidentally trigger a mode switch just by touching your shoulder. In fact, you can also switch modes by accident when trying to power on or off the device. 

This set has a proximity sensor and, in theory, can sense when you take off the headphones. It will then automatically stop whatever is playing, and resume when it senses you put them back. And when it works, it's amazing. Unfortunately, as many have mentioned it online, this feature does not work. Instead, it will very frequently and randomly send an A2DP pause signal while you are wearing them. And forget about using this feature on the desktop. It will constantly pause a YouTube video.
