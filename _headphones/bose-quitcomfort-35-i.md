So far, the best headphones I've tried.

I don't think I need to explain why this set of headphones are great. There's a reason why they are either number 1 or 2 in every list.
I've had my fair share of headphones and none of them come close to how comfortable these are to wear, as well as how perfectly they fit, how they handle with one hand, and how light they are. And the built quality is unmatched, even for headphones of it's price range.
I've worn them so much that I'm ordering my third replacement ear cuffs.

It's very hard to find any negatives with this pair. My biggest one is consider an extra selling feature: the ability to pair with two devices simultaneously. This is tricky to explain why I don't like it without context.

So I usually have three devices I'd like to connect my on-the-go headphones: my podcast player, my laptop, and my phone. 90% of the time, I care about my podcast player. 7% of time I want to listen something on my laptop, and only 3% I want to connect it to my phone.
So as you can see, switching to other devices doesn't happen very often. So I don't care for this feature. However, because of the way it works, rotating between 3 devices it becomes more annoying than if it didn't have this feature altogether. 

With a single-pairing headphones, if you want to switch to something, you simply turn on pairing mode, pair, and listen. With Bose, you have to constantly remember what the 2 paired devices are, because if your podcast device is in the device list 2nd, and your laptop is 1st, if you pair it with a phone, the headphones drops the podcast player and now you can only listen to your laptop and phone. 

To fix this, you either have to pair your podcast player again, or remove the unrelated devices using the phone app (if your phone is paired). 
On the surface, it sounds like you are doing the same thing with a single-pair set, but the fact that you have to remember what the two currently pair devices are makes this an unnecessary hassle.

But other than this, I don't know if I have anything else negative to say about them.
