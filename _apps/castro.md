Too minimal for its asking price

When I first launched the app, I was a little confused with its UI. It seemed that it was paying way too much attention into these weird lists that episodes would automatically be assigned to. I couldn't figure out what the difference between each list was on my own so I looked it up online. Turns out, there are two major lists: your Queue and your Inbox. When a new epsidoe of a podcast is published, by default it appears in the Inbox list. You can configure a podcast to place it in the Queue. The difference is actually a lot more useful than I originally gave it credit: episodes in Queue automatically downloaded and... well, queued to be played whereas in Inbox they don't. Episodes in Inbox have to be manually downloaded and manually played.

At first glance you would think "Why would any episode I subscribe to not be automatically queued and downloaded? After all, I wouldn't have subscribed otherwise." Which kinda makes sense until you realize that Inbox makes it a lot easier to discover new podcasts without littering your queue or have episodes of a podcast you occasionally like placed there. There are many times where I would subscribe to a new podcast to test it out only to constantly remove it from queue because "I'm not in the mood for this right now".

So Castro changed the way I now organize my podcasts. Aaaand that's about it for the positive things. Let's talk about the negatives.

When I first launched the app, I was not a fan of its very limited features. The podcast details page, for example, is severely lacking. But when I realized its "gimick" I assumed this is probably still an idea being explored. And then I saw the ads. At first I didn't mind. My threshold for paying to remove ads is very low lately. If I use an app for more than 2 weeks (sometimes less) I will very likely pay. So out of curiosity I checked the price to remove them, and to my surprise, it's not a one-time payment. It's a $2.99 monthly Plus subscription or $18.99 yearly. This made me think back to the apps "idea being explored" theory. Is this app, that's just launched, expecting people to subscribe? It barely has any features to justify using it for free, let alone paying it monthly.

So I went to tha app store to read some reviews, only to discover that some of them are 2 years old.

2 years old.

This app is, at least, 2 years old? How? This app is barely an MVP. I mean, I know it boasts about its minimalism, but come on! Minimalism doesn't mean *no* features. It should mean few features. Or lots of features, just hidden behind obscure settings. What are people paying for exactly? It's not like all the advanced features are hidden behind the subscription. That would make sense. But no, the subscription gives you access to some small features. The podcast details page is still completely empty.

So yeah, I gave Castro its fair share of a month of usage but I just couldn't wait to go back to my main player. Sometimes I cheated and played some podcasts in others while testing this app.

What can I say? Minimalism is just not for me.
