This app is aptly named. Podcast Addict is a podcast app for podcast power users with all the amazing features you'll never find anywhere else and a UI as terrible as, unfortunately, we've come to expect when we hear the words "power user".

Compare these two screenshots of the same podcast series, one from Podcast Addict (left) and one from Pocket Casts (right) , and you'll immediately understand what I'm talking about.

Notice how both apps have very similar information displayed, but one of them feels very convoluted and intimidating.

And because of the sheer number of features, simple actions like searching for new podcasts, take multiple steps where in other apps it takes at most two. 

Likes
- Notification contains summary of downloaded episode
- Widget contains timeline
- Lots of poweruser features (change podcast name, URL, artwork, etc)

Dislikes
- Terrible browsing experience
- Waaaaay too much text
- UI just feels old
- Very confusing navigation. Can't go back to episode list from playing now screen
- Confusing symbols. No idea what green corner with a plus sign is
- Played episode not distinguishing enough from unplayed
- Terrible UI. Needlessly complicated. 4 different menus with tons of options and no submenus.
- Poweruser features creeping in the UI when they are really not that important
