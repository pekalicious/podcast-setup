I've been a fan of Pocket Casts since 2011. And as of Oct 2019, I'm a happy Pocket Casts Plus subscriber. Seriously, I can't praise this app enough. Naturally a lot of the features I list in my app requirements are coming from features I've been used to in Pocket Casts.Â 

Probably one of the best UIs out there by a mile. Its Now Playing screen is second to none. Always available, has all the features you'd expect without bogging down the UI, simple scroll down to view your Up Next queue, etc, etc. I've yet to come across any app that's this intuitive to use. And considering that the Now Playing screen is the most important part of a podcast app, it's surprising how many apps get it wrong.
