Dislikes

- Hard to find Playing Now screen
- Can't find episode list from Playing Now screen
- Don't like that the list includes separators with dates
- No Play button in the episode list
- Widget not correctly updating the playing state
- Lock screen confusing. Volume slider looks like timeline.
- Volume slider value is more legible than actual timeline
- Sometimes later seasons don't load as you scroll and you have to select from seasons drop down list

Interesting
